	Mr. Monkey woke up at 7am this morning,  He made himself a poppy seed bagel with cream cheese for breakfast, 
and then took a shower.  Millard Monkey knew that this would be a special day; so he decided to wear his favorite fuzzy 
blue suit.  He combed his hair, and slid his shiny black shoes on.  He grabbed his umbrella just in case, and left 
through the front door.  As he went to step off the porch, he noticed the giant yellow banana.
